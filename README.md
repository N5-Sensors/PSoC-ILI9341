The PSoC Custom component features all the useful methods to interface a PSoC board with a ILI9341 based TFT display. To date, 
the component was tested with a [PSoC 5LP Development Kit](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and). 
The component requires the presence, on the schematic, of an SPI Component to work.
